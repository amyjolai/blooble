new file
This is from commit 1:
So what I did was delete exactly the <<<HEAD and ===== and the parent xxxxxx lines, then tick the box, put in a commit message;
and committed the resolved conflicts, along with adding this new file (despite this being a revert);

Chrysanthemum:
I added the Chrysanthemum.jpg
I changed the filename
I was not able to immediately revert to the old filename via rolling back to the previous commit
HOWEVER if I reverted back to the commit just before I added Chrysanthemum and THEN revert back to the name change commit - you get the original name back;
WHEN YOU REVERT BACK TO A COMMIT, YOU REVERT TO THE STATUS OF THE FILES, JUST BEFORE THE COMMIT YOU REVERT TO (i.e. you actually end up with the files
in the status they were before that commit was made)
